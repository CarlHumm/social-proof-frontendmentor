### What I learned

I should take more time to think about how the design will flow at different sizes and where to include media queries rather than relying on estimates and best guesses. Turned into abit of a hacky mess despite being a simple layout as I found myself adjusting/overwriting smaller viewport styles after writing the styles for the next breakpoint.

Lesson learnt, save time and make it more manageable and maintainable by tackling it in a sequential manner, not getting ahead of yourself and being sure to check styles before moving onto the next major block.
